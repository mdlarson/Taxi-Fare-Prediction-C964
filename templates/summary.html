            <h2>Data Summary</h2>
            <p>The selected visualizations below will help understand the taxi fare data behind the taxi fare prediction
                model, and the
                competitive landscape of high-volume, for-hire vehicles in New York City as a whole.</p>
            <p><b>Average Cost by Borough</b><br>
                As expected, we see below in the catplot that trips originating in
                Staten Island are the most expensive, and trips originating in Queens are the least expensive. This is
                largely a function of distance from LaGuardia Airport.

            <p><b>Top Pickup Locations</b><br>
                In the barplot below, note the log scale on the x-axis. Riders in
                Manhattan make up the largest share of
                trips, more than all other boroughs combined. Extremely high-cost outliers were excluded from the model,
                which significantly reduces the number of trips originating in Staten Island in this figure, with
                benefit of improving overall model accuracy.</p>

            <p><b>Distribution of Fares</b><br>
                Fares have a two-peaked distribution, as visible in the histogram below, with a local maximum around
                $18-22 and overall maximum at $50–55. The dip in cost is often a result of variance in congestion fees
                and/or tolls for trips of similar distance.</p>

            <p><b>Average Cost by Pickup Hour</b><br>
                The following barplot shows that trip costs increase steadily through the early morning
                hours, plateau from mid-morning through lunch hours, rise again to the peak afternoon commute/rush
                hours, then steeply decline through the evening. There is an arbitrage opportunity for riders after
                9pm and before midnight, when the typical ride costs ~10–20% less than the hours immediately before and
                after.</p>

            <p><b>Cost by Hour of Day</b><br>
                The boxplot offers another look at variance and distribution of taxi ride cost over the
                course of a day. The afternoon hours have the highest median costs, and the greatest variability in
                fares. Early morning and late night hours tend to be lower in cost, and more consistent.</p>
