                understand the competitive landscape as a whole.</p>
            <p>Average Cost by Borough<br>
                As expected, we see below in the _____graph_type____ that trips originating in
                Staten
                Island are the most expensive, and trips originating in Queens are the least expensive. This is largely
                a function of distance from LGA.</p>

            <p>Top Pickup Locations<br>
                In the _____graph_type____ below, note the log scale on the x-axis. Riders in
                Manhattan make up the largest share of
                trips, more than all other boroughs combined. (High-cost outliers were excluded from the model, which
                significantly reduces the number of trips originating in Staten Island in this figure, with benefit of
                improving overall model accuracy.)</p>

            <p>Distribution of Fares<br>
                Fares have a two-peaked distribution, with a local maximum around $18-22 and
                overall maximum at $50–55. The dip in cost is a result of variance in congestion fees and tolls for
                local trips of similar distance.</p>

            <p>Average Cost by Pickup Hour<br>
                The _____graph_type____ shows that trip costs increase steadily through the early morning
                hours, plateau from mid-morning through lunch hours, creat to peak afternoon commute/rush hours, then
                steeply decline through the evening. There appears to exist an arbitrage opportunity for riders after
                9pm and before midnight. Though there is higher variance at those hours, the typical ride costs ~10–20%
                less than the hours immediately before and after.</p>

            <p>Cost by Hour of Day<br>
                The below _____graph_type____ offers another look at variance in cost through the
                course of the day.</p>
