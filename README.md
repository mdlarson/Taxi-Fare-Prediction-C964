This was a machine learning student project developed for a computer science degree program. The customer was a fictional limousine company needing a method to research competitor fares.

I sourced high-volume, for-hire vehicle trip data from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, and used Random Forest Regression to develop a model to predict taxi fares to LaGuardia Airport. I developed a user interface for staff to select a pickup time and pickup location (neighborhood), and view the predicted competitor fare. The interface was built as a Python/Flask web app deployed on Heroku, and included a separate page for data visualizations.
